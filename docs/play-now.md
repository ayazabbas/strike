Strike runs as a Telegram bot on BSC Testnet. You can start playing in under a minute — no wallet setup, no browser extensions, no seed phrases.

## Step 1: Open the Bot

👉 [**@StrikePriceTestnetBot**](https://t.me/StrikePriceTestnetBot)

Tap the link or search for `StrikePriceTestnetBot` in Telegram.

## Step 2: Create Your Wallet

Send `/start` to the bot. A wallet is created for you automatically — no seed phrase to write down, no MetaMask to install.

Your wallet address will be shown on screen. Copy it.

## Step 3: Get Testnet BNB

You need tBNB (free testnet tokens) to place bets.

1. Go to the [BNB Chain Testnet Faucet](https://www.bnbchain.org/en/testnet-faucet)
2. Paste your wallet address
3. Request tBNB

It should arrive within a few seconds.

## Step 4: Place Your First Bet

1. Tap **⚡ Live** to see the current round
2. You'll see the **strike price** (BTC price when the round started) and the **current price**
3. Think BTC will be higher in 5 minutes? Tap **🟢 UP**. Lower? Tap **🔴 DOWN**
4. Pick a bet size (0.01, 0.05, or 0.1 tBNB) or enter a custom amount

That's it! Your bet is placed onchain.

## Step 5: Wait & Collect

The round resolves automatically after 5 minutes. If you won:

1. Tap **🎲 My Bets**
2. Tap **Claim** to collect your winnings

Winnings are sent directly to your embedded wallet.
